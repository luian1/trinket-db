                <p id="exp1" class="explain" hidden>Due to the different sentence structures, reading sentences that
                    contradict rules you've followed your whole life may throw you off. This may not seem too horrible
                    if you get used to it, but this is just the general structure. Many of the following points also tie
                    into sentence structure, but to start off, this is just the differences on a general level.
                </p>

                <h1 class="listPoint">Context</h1>
                <p class="ENlist">Context isn't necessarily needed to understand sentences</p>
                <p class="JPlist">Context is often crucial to understanding sentences</p>
                <h1 id="ex2" class="explain" onmousedown="showEx()">+</h1>
                <p id="exp2" class="explain" hidden>Japanese is a very contextual language in practice. Like in English,
                    there are many similar sounding words that when spoken only make sense with context. For reasons
                    that will be covered later, there are far more similar words in Japanese than in English. This isn't
                    even the main point to be made here; tieing into the previous comparison, the subject is often
                    omitted. Being a contextual language, aside from introducing the subject into a conversation, there
                    isn't a need to bring it up again later in the conversation. This makes a lot of sentences Object >
                    Verb, and in very informal settings, you might only reply with a verb if the subject and object were
                    already brought up.
                </p>

                <h1 class="listPoint">Particles</h1>
                <p class="ENlist">Important to use</p>
                <p class="JPlist">Vital to understand, many different applications</p>
                <h1 id="ex3" class="explain" onmousedown="showEx()">+</h1>
                <p id="exp3" class="explain" hidden>Japanese particles are very different. They can directly mean
                    something in English, sometimes the meaning changes
                    based on context, or they can just be "markers". The first particle you learn <span
                        class="jp">は</span><sup>ha</sup> ('ha', but pronounced as 'wa'
                    when used as a particle) doesn't really mean anything. It's actually used before the topic to mark
                    it, hence why
                    it's often called the "topic marker". Similarly, <span class="jp">を</span><sup>wo</sup> is the "verb
                    marker".
                    This is because there aren't any spaces in written Japanese, but rather particles are used to mark
                    parts of a sentence.
                    Because of this, it's crucial to understand particles to break up a sentence into its parts.
                    Particles are used like
                    they are in English too. Granted, it could be referred to as a "directional marker", but the
                    particle <span class="jp">に</span><sup>ni</sup>
                    can be used as "at" or "to". English has negative particles, so what's the way to say "not" in
                    Japanese. Well it
                    isn't exactly a particle, you instead conjugate the verb to a negative form. On the topic of
                    modifying the verb,
                    to mark a question, you put <span class="jp">か</span><sup>ka</sup> to make the verb a question (is.
                    > is it?).
                    Phrases like "you know", or
                    "isn't it" aren't words, but rather the particles <span class="jp">よ</span><sup>yo</sup> and <span
                        class="jp">ね</span><sup>ne</sup> respectively that also go at the end of a sentence.
                </p>

                <h1 class="listPoint">Formalities</h1>
                <p class="ENlist">While it is good practice, politeness isn't exactly required</p>
                <p class="JPlist">Formalities are deeply rooted into Japanese culture</p>
                <h1 id="ex4" class="explain" onmousedown="showEx()">+</h1>
                <img id="cHon" class="chart" src="images/site/honor.jpg" alt="Honorifics chart" hidden>
                <p id="exp4" class="explain" hidden>Japanese "Keigo" describes a system with different levels of
                    formality. It's generally Informal and Formal speech, but there are many levels of nuance in
                    those categories as well. Formal speech often entails appending certain suffixes/honorifics to a
                    person's name, and the name you refer to people by is their last name. In informal speech you'd
                    often drop the honorifics and refer to people by their first name. Verbs are also altered by Keigo.
                    Different ways of conjugating verbs are considered formal or informal, and even if they mean the
                    same thing, it's courteous to use the appropriate verb endings. For example: a polite sentence about
                    eating would end in <span class="jp">食</span><sup>ta</sup><span
                        class="jp">べ</span><sup>be</sup><span class="jp">ま</span><sup>ma</sup><span
                        class="jp">す</span><sup>su</sup></span> whereas the same sentence in a casual sentence would end
                    in <span class="jp">食</span><sup>ta</sup><span class="jp">べ</span><sup>be</sup><span
                        class="jp">る</span><sup>ru</sup>.
                    Before you get any ideas, don't think you can get away with just learning the formal language to
                    avoid ever being impolite. If you use formal language with people you're close to, they could feel
                    that you're treating them like a stranger and they'll feel distant.
                </p>

                <h1 class="listPoint">Writing System(s)</h1>
                <p class="ENlist">Alphabet</p>
                <p class="JPlist">Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, Romaji</p>
                <h1 id="ex5" class="explain" onmousedown="showEx()">+</h1>
                <img id="cAna" class="chart" src="images/site/_ana.png" alt="Hiragana/Katakana chart" hidden>
                <p id="exp5" class="explain" hidden>Technicially for comparison's sake, romaji refers to the alphabet
                    meaning there's only 3 writing systems different from ours. Romaji isn't used much if at all in
                    everyday conversation, but sees use in media and tourist locations.
                    The first of the Japanese writing systems is hiragana, which is one of the basic writing systems.
                    It's used for all the particles, conjugations, *base words, and *japanese names. Katakana has all
                    the same characters/meanings as hiragana but are written in a different script. This is because
                    katakana is used for very different reasons. Katakana is used for foreign words, foreign names, loan
                    words, and sayings.
                    Both hiragana and katakana can be modified by quotation mark like marks and circle marks called
                    daukten ﾞ and handakuten ﾟ respectively. This can create consonants that aren't in the base writing
                    systems. For instance <span class="jp">は</span><sup>ha</sup> > <span
                        class="jp">ば</span><sup>ba</sup> > <span class="jp">ぱ</span><sup>pa</sup>. Note that these marks
                    aren't supported by every
                    character. Sokuon is another way to modify these writing systems and refers to small versions of
                    hiragana and katakana. For the 's' characters there's sa, shi, su, se, so, but the idea of sha, shu,
                    she, sho exist. By using sokuon you can modify the vowels to make them (<span class="jp">しゃ</span>,
                    <span class="jp">しゅ</span>, <span class="jp">シェ</span>, <span class="jp">しょ</span>, note that I
                    wrote "she" in katakana as it's only used in loan words). A sokuon tsu (<span class="jp">つ</span>)
                    can extend syllables, for
                    example <span class="jp">か</span><sup>ka</sup><span class="jp">た</span><sup>ta</sup> > <span
                        class="jp">か</span><sup>ka</sup><span class="jp">っ</span><sup>t</sup><span class="jp">
                        た</span><sup>ta</sup>. Much like han/dakuten, sokuon only exist for certain
                    characters. <br>
                    Finally, the most intimidating part of the language to many, Kanji. <span
                        class="jp">漢</span><sup>kan</sup> (Chinese) <span class="jp">字</span><sup>ji</sup> (character),
                    this word means its literal translation, this writing system is the Chinese writing
                    system. Kanji is often used to condense the language. Earlier I said hiragana was used for *base
                    words, and *japanese names because in many cases they're actually condensed down to kanji. For
                    example the
                    name "Shigeru" is a fairly common Japanese name and rather than being written as <span
                        class="jp">しげる</span> it's written
                    as <span class="jp">茂</span>. Kanji isn't only used for condensing words, it's used to distinguish
                    similar words too.
                    "kimasu"
                    depending on the kanji could mean "to come"(<span class="jp">来ます</span>) or "to wear"(<span
                        class="jp">着ます</span>). Lastly, there are two readings
                    of (nearly) every kanji, On'yomi (based on the Chinese readings) and Kun'yomi (Native Japanese
                    readings). For example, water (<span class="jp">水</span>) could be sui (on'yomi)
                    or mizu (kun'yomi). It's complicated when to use which, but a general rule of thumb is if the kanji
                    is alone,
                    you use kun'yomi, and if it's next to other kanji, you use on'yomi.
