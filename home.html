    <h1>What is this page about?</h1>
    <p>Japanese is considered one of the hardest languages for an English speaker to learn. As far as languages with a
        similar reputation, Japanese doesn't seem as intimidating. There are many writing systems more intimidating to
        an English speaker than Japanese scripts, and it isn't a tonal language which makes it a far easier spoken
        language for English people than languages that are. If that's the case, why is English considered one of the
        hardest languages for an english speaker? And despite being a compulsary subject in schools across Japan, why is
        Japan's English proficency so low?</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Why is this the case?</h1>
    <p>These questions all boil down to one aspect of the language I haven't brought up: language structure. These
        languages' structures are drastically different which forms all sorts of language barriers which will be documented here. To
        a general audience, these are some interesting facts, and to people learning Japanese or looking to learn, these concepts are
        important things to keep in mind to communicate properly.</p>
